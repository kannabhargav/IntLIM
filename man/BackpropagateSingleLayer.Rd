\title{Run backpropagation for a single layer. In backpropagation, a gradient is
is computed by taking partial derivatives for each of the model weights. Given
a learning rate, the weights are adjusted according to the gradient.}
\usage{
BackpropagateSingleLayer(modelResults, iteration, convolution, pooling)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelResults}{An object of the ModelResults class.}

\item{iteration}{The current iteration.}

\item{convolution}{Whether or not to perform convolution}
